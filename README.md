# Population-Dataset

As part of the team, I would approach the task as follows:

1 Database Connection and setup:
  Create a new database or use an existing one to store the population dataset.
  Set up the necessary database connection parameters in the Python program.
  
2 Data Fetching ,cleaning and storing:
  Write Python code to fetch the dataset from data source its can public data souce of preivate. This can be done using APIs or by parsing CSV or JSON files other language selenium.
  Iterate the fetched data and insert it into the database. Ensure proper handling of data types any necessary transformations or cleaning of data , data time format.

3 SQL Query Execution:
  Write an SQL query to  get the data based on the requirement.
  Execute the SQL query using Python's database connectivity module (e.g., pyodbc, psycopg2, or mysql-connector).
  Retrieve the query result.
  
4 Automation:
Ensure that the database connection details, file paths, and other configurations are properly managed and maintained.

5 Documentation and Version Control:
  Provide clear and concise documentation, including a README file 
  Use GIT to track changes, manage branches, and collaborate with other team members.
  Create a GitHub repository to host the code, allowing for code review and sharing with the team.
